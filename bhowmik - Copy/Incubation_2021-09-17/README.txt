ECD was apparently not giving signal for samples 1-18. By the time i cought it I had been in faculty meeting for 2 hours so a looooooot of samples ran pointlessly. Not sure what happened, It was giving signal when I hit run, then mustve gone wrong immediately after that. To fix the problem I turned it off and back on at the start of sample 19 when i noticed the problem. Anyways there is another folder with its own batch file and samples for the samples 18 to be run again, Incubation_2021-09-17_2. 

So for n2o the reconstructed order should be:

19-35 this folder (C:\GCsolution\Data\Sean\2020\Batchfiles_and_Data\Incubation_2021-09-17)
9-18 in C:\GCsolution\Data\Sean\2020\Batchfiles_and_Data\Incubation_2021-09-17_2 (gc sampled the second time this run)
2-8 in C:\GCsolution\Data\Sean\2020\Batchfiles_and_Data\Incubation_2021-09-17_3 (gc sampled the 3rd time this run)
1 in C:\GCsolution\Data\Sean\2020\Batchfiles_and_Data\Incubation_2021-09-17_4 (gc sampled the 4th time this run)

Then i tried to put all them together using the gcsolution:
These are in the C:\GCsolution\Data\Sean\2020\Batchfiles_and_Data\Incubation_2021-09-17-5\2021-09-17_NC_R1_CC_SF_PL_INC_Day 35-H2O 3 Day 35_compiled.txt ascii file and ...
"C:\GCsolution\Data\Sean\2020\Batchfiles_and_Data\Incubation_2021-09-17-5\2021-09-17_NC_R1_CC_SF_PL_INC_Day 35-H2O 3 Day 35_compiled.gcb" batch file\
